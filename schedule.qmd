## Daily Programme

## Sub-topics proposed in preparation meetings

* Sustainability:
    * What will happen to the tools when the funding runs out?
    * How do we keep the project going?
    
* Inclusivity:
    * Where do we locate the global south?

* Building collaboration:
    * Bringing a broader audience to the summit such as the private sector, agencies in the region, and other research groups
    * Establishing alliances with the ones who might find the project useful to them and their organizations.
    
* Training:
    * What have we learned from the training feedback conducted by both the TRACE-Lac and the LSHTM team?
    * How can we adapt the TRACE-LAC training materials to Africa?
