## Daily egenda

## Sub-topics proposed in preparation meetings

* Sustainability:
    * what will happen to the tools when the funding runs out?
    * How do we keep the project going?
    
* Inclusivity:
    * Where do we locate the global south?

* Building collaboration:
    * bringing a broader audience to the summit such as private sector, agencies in the region, other research groups
    * Establishing alliance with the ones who might find the project useful to them and their organisations.
    
* Training:
    * What have we learnt from the feedbacks of the training conducted by both the TRCAE-Lac and the LSHTM team?
    * How can we adapt the TRACE-Lac training materials to Africa?
