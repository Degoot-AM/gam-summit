### Tuesday

**Inclusivity and sustainability  of Epiverse-TRACE tools**


Discuss the inclusivity and sustainability of the project tools  


**Objectives:**

-   Assess how well the project tools currently address diverse populations and settings.
-   Identify gaps in inclusivity (e.g., language barriers, accessibility).
-   Identify opportunities for collaboration from the gaps and needs from phase 1.
-   Expand the scope of our tools to cover public health threats in other parts of the world.
-   Explore the sustainability of the project.

**Expected outcomes:**

-   Identification of:
    -   potential collaborators to fulfill the gaps and needs,
    -   our strengths and weaknesses,
    -   ways of covering more health issues.
-   A strategic roadmap for ensuring the continued relevance and use of our tools post-project.

### Thursday

**Adoption of Epiverse-TRACE for small-scale outbreaks, NTDs, one health, and disease surveillance**

These sessions  focused on how the Epiverse-TRACE analytical tools can be applied beyond infectious diseases. Discussions will cover their usage in context of small-scale local outbreaks, neglected tropical diseases (__NTDs__), one health perspectives, and in disease surveillance.

**objectives**:

  - Explore how Epiverse-TRACeE tools can be adapted for non-infectious disease contexts, particularly in small-scale local outbreaks and neglected tropical diseases.
  - One Health Approach: Highlight the integration to the one health perspective, considering the interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment.
  - Enhance Surveillance: Discuss the potential of these tools in enhancing surveillance systems across various health domains.

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Gain insights into the broader applicability of Epiverse-TRACeE tools beyond traditional infectious disease analytics.
- Identify opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations and partnerships to enhance surveillance and outbreak response

**Moderators**:

- Natalia Ni√±o, Bubacarr Bah, and Adam Kucharski

### Firday 

**Outbreak analytical course and gaps within the project** 

This session will focus on how to design a data-centered outbreak analytics course aimed at training and teaching outbreak analysis. It will also reflect on lessons learnt and identify current gaps within the project and explore ways to overcome these challenges.

**Objectives**:

-  Develop a comprehensive and practical outbreak analytics course that effectively teaches key concepts and methods
- Identify and discuss existing gaps within the project related to training, tools, and resources.

**Expected outcomes**:

- Draft Course Framework: A preliminary framework for the outbreak analytics course, including key topics, teaching methods, and assessment strategies.
-  Plans to address the gaps, with specific implementation steps

**Moderators**: 

- Andree, Degoot, and Diana
