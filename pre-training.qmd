**Times:** 9:30-12:30 and 14:00 - 17:00

**Location:** F1 seminar room in MRCG

### Overview:

This week-long in-person workshop provide a practical introduction to outbreak data analysis using R packages developed by the Epiverse-TRACE initiative..

## Workshop content

### Day 1

-   Why use R packages for epidemic analytics?
-   How to import data into the R environment?
-   How to manipulate data in R?
-   How to perform visualization in R?

### Day 2

-   How to clean and standardize case data?
-   How to aggregate and visualize case data?
-   How can I ensure the above tasks are performed in an efficient and reproducible way?

### Day 3

-   How do I simulate disease spread using a mathematical model?
-   How do I investigate the effect of interventions on disease trajectories?
-   How can we simulate transmission chains based on infection characteristics?

### Day 4

-   What are the delay distributions and what is their usage on outbreak analytics?
-   How to access delay distributions from a literature search database?
-   How can I estimate key transmission metrics from a time series of case data?
-   How do I account for incomplete reporting in forecasts?

### Day 5

-   How to estimate the case fatality ratio (CFR) and adjust for common biases?
-   How can we estimate individual-level variation in transmission (i.e. superspreading potential)?
