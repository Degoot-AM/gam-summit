## Outbreak analytics with R - training {#pre-summit-training}

**Dates:** Monday 25 November to Friday 29 November 2024 (5 days)

**Times:** 9:30-12:30 and 14:00 - 17:00

**Location:** F1 seminar room in MRCG

### Overview:

This week-long in-person workshop provide a practical introduction to outbreak data analysis using R packages developed by the Epiverse-TRACE initiative.



## Tentative course content

### Day 1

-   Introduction to outbreak analytics and "Outbreak Data Challenges"
-   Why use R packages for epidemic analytics?
-   How to manipulate data and perform visualizatio in R?

### Day 2

-   How do I simulate disease spread using a mathematical model?
-   How do I investigate the effect of interventions on disease trajectories?

### Day 3

-   How to clean and standardize case data?
-   How to aggregate and visualize case data?
-   How can I ensure the above tasks are performed in an efficient and reproducible way?

### Day 4

-   What are the delay distributions and what is their usage in outbreak analytics?
-   How to access delay distributions from a literature search database?
-   How can I estimate key transmission metrics from a time series of case data?
-   How do I account for incomplete reporting in forecasts?

### Day 5

-   How to estimate the case fatality ratio (CFR) and adjust for common biases?
-   How can we estimate individual-level variation in transmission (i.e. superspreading potential)?
-   How can we simulate transmission chains based on infection characteristics?

## Prerequisites

Attendees will be using their own laptops. We expect participants to have some exposure to basic statistical, mathematical and epidemic theory concepts, but NOT necessarily familiarity with analytics or modelling. This training requires you to be familiar with:

-   **Data science**: Some basic familiarity with R software
-   **Statistics**: Familiarity with common probability distributions, such as the Normal, Gamma, Log normal, and Negative binomial distributions.
-   **Epidemic theory**: Familiarity with common epidemiological parameters, such as the incubation period, generation time, serial interval, and metrics such as the reproduction number.


## Application 

Fill out this [form to apply](https://forms.office.com/e/MdHMYMKmC7) for this training. Application deadline is **Friday 27th September**. Places are limited and will be given on a first come, first served basis. There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for travel and local expenses. Application data will be kept confidential and may only be published in aggregated and anonymised form in Epiverse-TRACE outreach reports. If you have questions about the training, please send an email to [andree.valle-campos\@lshtm.ac.uk]() or [lshad35\@lshtm.ac.uk]().
