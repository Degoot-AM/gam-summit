**Times:** 9:30-12:30 and 14:00 - 17:00

**Location:** F1 seminar room in MRCG

### Overview:

This week-long in-person workshop provide a practical introduction to outbreak data analysis using R packages developed by the Epiverse-TRACE initiative.

## Course content

### Day 1

-   Why use R packages for epidemic analytics?
-   How to import data into the R environment?
-   How to manipulate data in R?
-   How to perform visualization in R?

### Day 2

-   How do I simulate disease spread using a mathematical model?
-   How do I investigate the effect of interventions on disease trajectories?
-   How can we estimate final size of an epidemic?

### Day 3

-   How to clean and standardize case data?
-   How to aggregate and visualize case data?
-   How can I ensure the above tasks are performed in an efficient and reproducible way?

### Day 4

-   What are the delay distributions and what is their usage in outbreak analytics?
-   How to access delay distributions from a literature search database?
-   How can I estimate key transmission metrics from a time series of case data?
-   How do I account for incomplete reporting in forecasts?

### Day 5

-   How to estimate the case fatality ratio (CFR) and adjust for common biases?
-   How can we estimate individual-level variation in transmission (i.e. super-spreading potential)?
-   How can we simulate transmission chains based on infection characteristics?

## Prerequisites

Attendees will be using their own laptops. We expect participants to have some exposure to basic statistical, mathematical and epidemic theory concepts, but NOT necessarily familiarity with analytics or modelling. This workshop requires you to be familiar with:

-   **Data science**: Some basic familiarity with R software
-   **Statistics**: Familiarity with common probability distributions, such as the Normal, Gamma, Log normal, and Negative binomial distributions.
-   **Epidemic theory**: Familiarity with common epidemiological parameters, such as the incubation period, generation time, serial interval, and metrics such as the reproduction number.
