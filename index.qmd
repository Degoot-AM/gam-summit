# Strenthening Equitable and Inclusive Tools for Epidemic Preparedness

The [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and regional organisations are supporting the development and use of analytics tools for epidemics preparedness and response. Powered by [Data.org](https://data.org/), the [Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/) project has made a substantial progress towards producing analytics tools aimed at addressing the most critical questions during an epidemics. Current, up to XXX Epiverse-TRACE packages are on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). While YYY are under active development, this reflects the results of two years of joint efforts between members of the team and our communities of users.

These tools are developed across three institutions ([LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/), [MRCG](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/units/mrc-gambia), [UniAndes](https://uniandes.edu.co/), [Javeriana](https://javeriana.edu.co)) that are spread across three countries (The UK, The Gambia, and Colombia), and located in three Continents. Given the spread and the wide diversity of the team, it was decided, for a smooth integration and collaboration between the members, to organise a **summit** in one the above countries hosting the project. For a week or so, this is an opportunity to discuss the progress, evaluate the deliveries, and plan for our next moves.

This year, the Epiverse-TRACE annual summit will be held at the Medical Research Council, The Gambia Unit at LSHTM.

## Previous Summit

Our first summit was organised in Bogota, Colombia, between 26th and 29th of June 2023. Around the theme “Collaborative Software Development Ecosystem for Public Health”, participants had the opportunity to bring their thoughts in the following topics:

1. Collaborative Software Development,
2. Building a community of users,
3. Building RSE & Data Science teams,
4. TRACE in the Global Perspective

The outcomes from these fruitful discussions are summarised in the [report](https://zenodo.org/records/10932686) published by TRACE-LAC team in Colombia.
