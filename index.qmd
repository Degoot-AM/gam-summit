# Strengthening Inclusive and Sustainable Tools for Epidemic Preparedness

![](./images/Epiverse-Trace-Summit-group-photo-1920x1080.jpg){fig-align="center" width="100%" height="10%"}

The [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and regional organizations are supporting the development and use of analytics tools for epidemic preparedness and response. Powered by [Data.org](https://data.org/), the [Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/) project has made substantial progress towards producing analytics tools aimed at addressing the most critical questions during epidemics. Current, up to **six (6)** [Epiverse-TRACE packages](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/etstats/articles/cran-statistics.html) are on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). While close to **twenty (20)** are under active development, this reflects the results of two years of joint efforts between members of the team and our communities of users.

These tools are developed across three institutions ([LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/), [MRCG](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/units/mrc-gambia), [UniAndes](https://uniandes.edu.co/), [Javeriana](https://javeriana.edu.co)) that are spread across three countries (The UK, The Gambia, and Colombia), and located in three continents. Given the spread and the wide diversity of the team, it was decided, for smooth integration and collaboration between the members, to organize a **summit** in one of the above countries hosting the project. For a week or so, this is an opportunity to discuss the progress, evaluate the deliveries, and plan for our next moves.

This year, the Epiverse-TRACE annual summit will be held at the Medical Research Council, The Gambia Unit at LSHTM. Our teams and organizing committees are working for the success of the event, including the pre-summit training that will happen a week prior to the summit. The training will be conducted by our team of research fellows, supported by the RSEs. Participants will learn how to use our tools within an outbreak analysis workflow.

## Previous Summits

### Collaborative Software Development Ecosystem for Public Health

Our second summit was organized in **Bogota, Colombia**, between the 26th and 29th of June 2023. The participants were given the opportunity to bring their thoughts on the following topics:

1.  *Collaborative Software Development*,
2.  *Building a community of users*,
3.  *Building RSE & Data Science teams*,
4.  *TRACE in the Global Perspective*.

The outcomes from these fruitful discussions are summarised in the [report](https://zenodo.org/records/10932686) published by the TRACE-LAC team in Colombia.

The first Epiverse-TRACE summit was held in London, UK, between the 12th and 14th of December 2022. The event was organised in a form of a workshop around a central question: **“What should the first 100 lines of code written during new epidemics look like?”**. Together with groups working on processing and analysis pipelines, the organisations working on the front line response and generating data looked into the challenges around building efficient and centralised analysis pipelines. The main topics included:

1.  *Sharing experiences of outbreak responses*,
2.  *Identifying the challenges and questions during outbreaks*,
3.  *Building collaboration and pipelines*.

The details of the outcomes from these three days discussions are summarised in this [blogpost](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/posts/100days-workshop/index.html).
