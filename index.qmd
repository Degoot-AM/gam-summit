The [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and regional organizations are supporting the development and use of analytics tools for epidemic preparedness and response. Powered by [Data.org](https://data.org/), the [Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/) project has made substantial progress towards producing analytics tools aimed at addressing the most critical questions during epidemics. Current, up to **six (6)** [Epiverse-TRACE packages](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/etstats/articles/cran-statistics.html) are on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). While close to **twenty (20)** are under active development, this reflects the results of two years of joint efforts between members of the team and our communities of users.

These tools are developed across three institutions ([LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/), [MRCG](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/units/mrc-gambia), [UniAndes](https://uniandes.edu.co/), [Javeriana](https://javeriana.edu.co)) that are spread across three countries (The UK, The Gambia, and Colombia), and located in three continents. Given the spread and the wide diversity of the team, it was decided, for smooth integration and collaboration between the members, to organize a **summit** in one of the above countries hosting the project. For a week or so, this is an opportunity to discuss the progress, evaluate the deliveries, and plan for our next moves.

This year, the Epiverse-TRACE annual summit will be held at the Medical Research Council, The Gambia Unit at LSHTM. Our teams and organizing committees are working for the success of the event, including the pre-summit training that will happen a week prior to the summit. The training will be conducted by our team of research fellows, supported by the RSEs. Participants will learn how to use our tools within an outbreak analysis workflow.

## Previous Summit

Our first summit was organized in Bogota, Colombia, between the 26th and 29th of June 2023. Around the theme “Collaborative Software Development Ecosystem for Public Health”, participants had the opportunity to bring their thoughts on the following topics:

1. Collaborative Software Development,
2. Building a community of users,
3. Building RSE & Data Science teams,
4. TRACE in the Global Perspective

The outcomes from these fruitful discussions are summarised in the [report](https://zenodo.org/records/10932686) published by the TRACE-LAC team in Colombia.
